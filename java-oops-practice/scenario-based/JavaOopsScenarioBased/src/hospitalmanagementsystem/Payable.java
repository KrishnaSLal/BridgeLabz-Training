/*1. Hospital Patient Management System
Scenario: A hospital wants a software module to register patients, assign doctors, and maintain
billing.
Concepts Used:
● Class: Patient, Doctor, Bill
● Constructor: Overloaded for emergency vs. normal patient admission
● Access Modifiers: Keep sensitive data like medicalHistory as private, expose
getSummary() via public
● Interface: Payable with method calculatePayment() implemented in Bill
● Operators: Used to compute discounts, taxes, totals
● OOP:
○ Encapsulation: Private fields with getter/setters
○ Abstraction: Hide billing calculation behind interface
○ Inheritance: InPatient, OutPatient extend Patient
○ Polymorphism: displayInfo() overridden for Doctor, Patient, etc.*/


package hospitalmanagementsystem;

interface Payable {
    double calculatePayment();
}
